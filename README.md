# Breast-Cancer-Predictions-using-Machine-Learning

**Project Overview :**


Implementation of SVM Classifier To Perform Classification on the dataset of Breast Cancer Wisconin; to predict if the tumor is cancer or not.


Building some plots and graphs to take an overview about what your data looks like.


Machine Learning Algorithms used in this Notebook:


Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Kneighbours Classifier, Supportr vector Classifier


Evaluating the performance of SVM Classifier by Differents Metrics.


**Data Source :**

**Model Building :**

In this section, I tried different models and evaluate them using the Accuracy_Score:


. Logistic Regression


. Gradient Boosting Classifier


. Random Forest Classifier


. Decision Tree Classifier


. Kneighbours Classifier


. Support vector Classifier

**Model Performance :**

In this step, I evaluate the performance of the models using:


. Accuracy_Score


. Recall


. Precision


. Classification Report


. The ROC Curve
